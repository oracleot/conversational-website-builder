## The Guided Conversation

### Step 1: Business Type (🏢)

The AI will ask you to describe your business. Simply explain what you do in natural language.

**Example responses:**
- "I run a management consulting firm that helps small businesses grow"
- "I own a local bakery specializing in custom wedding cakes"
- "We're a digital marketing agency focused on e-commerce brands"

The AI will identify whether you're a:
- **Service Business** (consulting, agencies, professional services)
- **Local Business** (restaurants, salons, retail stores)

### Step 2: Business Info (📝)

Share your:
- Business name
- Tagline or slogan
- Target audience
- Brand personality (e.g., "professional but friendly", "modern and innovative")

**Example:**
> "My firm is called 'Strategic Growth Partners' with the tagline 'Empowering Small Businesses to Achieve Big Results'. We're professional but approachable."

### Step 3-9: Section Content

For each website section, the AI will ask targeted questions:

| Section | What You'll Provide |
|---------|---------------------|
| Hero | Main headline, call-to-action text |
| Services | List of services with descriptions |
| About | Your story, mission, team info |
| Process | How you work with clients |
| Portfolio | Past projects or case studies |
| Testimonials | Client quotes and reviews |
| Contact | Email, phone, location |

### Step 10: Review (✅)

Review all your content before finalizing. You can go back and edit any section.

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Conversational
Write naturally, as if talking to a colleague:
- ✅ "We help small businesses with their marketing strategy and brand development"
- ❌ "Marketing. Strategy. Brand development."

### Include Details
The more context you provide, the better:
- ✅ "Our ideal clients are SMBs with 10-50 employees who are ready to scale to the next level"
- ❌ "Small businesses"

### Describe Your Brand Personality
Help the AI choose the right design style:
- "Professional and trustworthy" → Classic, elegant design
- "Modern and innovative" → Bold, contemporary design
- "Friendly and approachable" → Warm, inviting design

## Troubleshooting

### The AI Didn't Understand My Response
Try rephrasing with more context:

- Better: "I offer web design services including custom websites, landing pages, and e-commerce stores"
