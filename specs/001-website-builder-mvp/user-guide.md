## AI-Powered Design Selection (Phase 5)

### How It Works

The AI analyzes your **brand personality** to automatically select the best design variant for each section. There are 5 variants per section:

| Variant | Style | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Professional | Corporate, consulting, law firms |
| 2 | Modern | Tech startups, agencies, SaaS |
| 3 | Bold | Creative agencies, artists, designers |
| 4 | Elegant | Luxury brands, high-end services, boutiques |
| 5 | Friendly | Local businesses, healthcare, education |

### Viewing AI Recommendations

When you hover over any section in the preview, you'll see:
- **AI Badge**: Shows why the AI selected this variant based on your brand
- **"See other options" Button**: Opens the variant carousel

### Switching Variants

1. Hover over any section in the preview
2. Click **"See other options"**
3. Browse all 5 variants with match scores
4. Click on a variant to switch instantly
5. Use **← →** arrow keys to navigate
6. Press **Esc** to close the carousel

### Understanding Match Scores

Each variant shows a **match percentage** based on your brand personality:
- **70%+** (Green): Excellent match
- **40-69%** (Yellow): Good match
- **<40%** (Gray): May work but less aligned

### AI Reasoning

The AI explains its selection, for example:
> "Selected variant 4 (85% match) because your 'elegant, sophisticated' brand personality aligns with its premium and refined design style."
